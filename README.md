# Battlesnake Machine Learning

Created by Nelith Ranaweera and 
### Overview

A machine learning project that replicates the behavior of a top-performing Battlesnake by training models such as SVMs, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks on gameplay data. The goal was to compare these training methods in mimicking strategic decision-making. The final model achieved a 90% accuracy in replicating the original models behaviour.
